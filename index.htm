        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I am a 22-year-old, engineer. I graduated from Manipal University Jaipur, where I pursued my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. I express a deep affinity towards creativity, and during my experience at University, I tried exploring many different domains my favorite being Web development.
        </p>
        <p>Fortunately, web development got the better part of my creativity. Being fairly new to development I actively seek challenges and opportunities to improve my skills.</p>
        <p>On lazy days I usually like making music, 3D art, and petting furry friends.</p>
        <p>I am open to work full-time/internships and would love to connect with like-minded individuals and recruiters for future prospects. So, if you are one of them, or if you have pets: don't be shy, do reach out to me!
        </p>

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
            I got a stellar opportunity to work with Ericsson, the global leader in the telecom industry. For seven months, I had an incredible learning experience from highly qualified individuals. I could gain a deeper understanding of a service-based organization.
        </p>
        <p>My future goal is to closely observe and be a part of a product based, colaborative organisation. Feel free to take a look at my resume!</p>
